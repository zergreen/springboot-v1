# Software Development in Practice by TN Incorparation
Build a "Web application" with Spring Boot, Maven, and MySQL
## Version Control with Git, and GitHub
### Stage your change first
#### Stage some change:
```
$ git add <file or directory>
```
#### Stage all your change:
```
$ git add -p
```
### Then you'll committed it
#### Commit all your change with commit message:
```
$ git commit -a -m "Your message here".
```

##### Commit message practice:
```
[Add/Edit/etc.] descript_aa at row bb in xx.file and row yy in zz.file 
```

### Push your commit to your remote repository
#### Just push it!:
```
$ git push
```

### There's conflicted, what happened!?
```Java
assertEquals(11, "1+1");
// Compare with
assertEquals(2, "1+1");
```

### Branch can help you!
#### Make a new branch
```
$ git checkout -b "branch-name"
```
#### List all local and remote branch:
```
$ git branch -a 
```

## CI/CD with Jenkins
